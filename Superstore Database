--For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 
#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT item_name
, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price
;
--Show a statistic about the item prices.
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
;
--Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
SELECT AVG(price)
, category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies"
;
-- Show which category has the lowest stock?
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity),
category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
;
