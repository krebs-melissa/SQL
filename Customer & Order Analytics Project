--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;
--#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = "iPhone"

--#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum as "account number"
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6

--#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product
,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

SELECT product
,round((sum(quantity)*price) , 2 ) as revenue
